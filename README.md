# Smart-Light-and-Sound-Monitor

## Introduction
This project is “Smart Light and Sound Monitor”, where the LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is used to measure the light intensity once the button is turned on. In this project, there are two inputs, which are the Sound Sensor and the LDR, and two outputs which are the LED and a Buzzer. 

Similar to smartphones, the brightness of the LED is inversely proportional to the light intensity. When the light intensity is high, then the LED brightness is low, and when the light intensity is low, then the LED brightness is high. In this project, once the light intensity is high, the buzzer will start to give “tick” sounds to inform the user that the LDR light intensity is high.

Hence, this means that the brightening of the LED changes depending on the light intensity. The behavior is achieved by adjusting the resistance in the circuit. As the LED brightness increases, the resistance decreases. The sound sensor is also used to detect any sound around, and light the LED based on how loud is the sound.
